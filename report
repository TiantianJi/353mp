1.	Introduction
The purpose of this project is to design a web-based database of a company management system using MySQL and PHP to set relations in between different components such as Employees, Department and projects, and keep track of the performances. 

In progress of building the system, an E/R relationship model is presented to explain relationship of entities. To enhance the system performance in long run, we decomposed the relations into 3NF. Constraints during creating system are listed to better understand the inner system structure. A brief introduction on our user interface is provided to help users getting on to it. Test data and some example queries are provided. 


2.	E/R Model


Since both department and project have location, we upgrade it to an entity, and created relation between location and department/project.
We picked SIN as key of Emploees
We picked DNumber as key of Department
...



3.	Convert to 3NF:

For all tuples with single key, they are already in 3NF, so no need to convert.
For table workOn, (PID, ESIN) -> hours, 3NF
For Dependent, 
             (DSIN, ESIN) -> dependentName , 3NF
             (DSIN, ESIN) -> dependentBirthday, 3NF
             (DSIN, ESIN) ->  dependentGender, 3NF
So all relations are in 3NF

No trivial dependencies found

5.	User Interface

Here is the login page of the management system

Once loged in, users could choose to search, add, delete or  update tuples by entering certain attributes.
